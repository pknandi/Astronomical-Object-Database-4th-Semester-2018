# Astronomical-Object-Database-4th-Semester-2018
My project idea was to build a database about astronomical object. It is more of like an encyclopedia type database where the information about the object like a star,a planet, a satellite or a galaxy, or even a constellation will be recorded so that one can find information from here. That’s why the idea is named after “Astronomical Object Database”.


## Features:
There are several features of the database project. Some are below here.
- This database will give us correct information about the astronomical
object.
- One can query any single or more information from here for different
purpose.
- Comparison between any two objects will be much more easier as the
database is designed like this way.
- The attributes discussed in the idea details section have been
implemented in the database. So, one can find all these data from the
database by a single query.

## Limitations:

The project is not fully done and has a lot of works left to do. Though it is
planned to make this database a very realistic one, it was hard to to collect
all the data about all the components and put them in the database correctly.
It is also not certain that all the data will be authentic due to source
limitation. There is a fatal limitation in the database. If a new star or nebula
or constellation is discovered and it can’t be sure that in which galaxy it is
located then the star or nebula name can’t be inserted into the database for
parent key constraint. But in spite of being all of these limitation present in
the project, these project is seemed very much helpful.
